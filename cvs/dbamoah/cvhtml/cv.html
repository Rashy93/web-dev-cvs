	<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
	<p>I am a hardworking, committed individual who recently completed my BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree at the University of Hertfordshire. During my time at the university I acquired a number of skills that I believe can help me both in the world of work and my personal life. Having a strong desire to learn new software and languages in regards to IT and having a keen interest in games design, programming and technology are just two of the personality traits that I carry which will bring me one step closer to being successful in no matter what I do in the near future. I am a reliable, trustworthy person who is able to work well within a team as well as on my own initiative. Now that I have finished my degree I am looking for an opportunity to not only learn new things to expand my way of thinking but also help others along the way. I have been looking at internships and graduate schemes as well as jobs in the IT sector for this purpose mainly in the role of web development and cant wait to put the skills I have acquired so far to the test in a more practical environment with a lot more pressure as I have always loved a challenge.</p>
