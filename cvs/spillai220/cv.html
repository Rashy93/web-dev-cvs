    <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="paragraph">Currently a 3rd year BSc undergraduate student at the University of East Anglia studying Computer Science.
       I am a highly motivated and hardworking individual who continuously strive to achieve my goals.
       I am capable of handling  high-pressure situation with good communication skills,
       teamwork and organisational skills which I have gained from working in collaborative activities
       to develop web-applications in a relatively small time-frame; I hope that this, along with my dedication,
       and work-ethic will assist me as an employee.
       After completing my studies, my long-term aspiration is to follow a career path in the Computing sector,
       particularly in software development; in order to do so, I am seeking real-world experience
       in various fields where I can continue to develop my knowledge and skillsets.

  <h3>Key Skills</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>I have worked collaboratively in developing small web application using Java, HTML5, CSS, SQL and JavaScript.
     These includes: Health Tracker application, Local Bike hire website, School Alumni site.
     I have worked on an Activity Program app a simple Android application  used to list all calendar events in an open day scenario.
     The app pulls information from an online calendar and synchronizes with it in regular (configurable) intervals,
     it also enables the user to set reminder notification for specified events.
     The final year project I am currently working on is: Car engine diagnostics using Raspberry Pi.
     This is carried out through cylinder compression and balance testing where Raspberry Pi is used to read
     spark plug voltages and the result is represented in a waveform pattern which is used to determine all
     engine cylinders are generally balanced; also to check if any are faulty (lower voltage peak).
     The following are programming languages that I worked with listed by proficiency:
  <ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>C/C++</li>
    <li>Android</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Matlab</li>
  </ul>
